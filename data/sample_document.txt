RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Overview

What is RAG?
RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It enhances language models by providing them with relevant context from a knowledge base before generating responses.

How RAG Works:
1. Document Ingestion: Documents are processed and converted into embeddings (vector representations)
2. Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database like Qdrant
3. Query Processing: When a user asks a question, it's converted into an embedding
4. Similarity Search: The system finds the most relevant documents based on vector similarity
5. Context Augmentation: Retrieved documents are used as context for the language model
6. Response Generation: The model generates a response using both the query and retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- Provides up-to-date information without retraining models
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in actual documents
- Allows for domain-specific knowledge integration
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning large language models

Common Use Cases:
- Question answering systems
- Customer support chatbots
- Document search and summarization
- Knowledge base queries
- Research assistants

Technical Components:
- Embedding Models: Convert text to vectors (e.g., sentence-transformers)
- Vector Databases: Store and search embeddings efficiently (e.g., Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Language Models: Generate responses based on context (e.g., GPT, Claude)
- Document Processors: Handle various file formats (PDF, DOCX, CSV, etc.)
